# Sprayberry Labs

**Building AI agents that actually use computers.**

Not chatbots. Not copilots. Digital employees that control mouse and keyboard, browse the web, SSH into servers, and run applications — exactly like a human worker.

## What Our Agents Do

| Capability | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Mouse & Keyboard | Move cursors, click buttons, type into fields, use shortcuts |
| Real Browser Sessions | Navigate websites, fill forms, extract data, take screenshots |
| Run Any Application | IDEs, spreadsheets, design tools, terminals |
| SSH Into Anything | Servers, containers, VMs, routers, IoT, cloud instances |
| File System Control | Read, write, organize files across codebases and documents |
| Shell & CLI | Build scripts, deploy pipelines, test suites, piped commands |

## Security & Privacy

Agents with full computer access demand uncompromising security:

- **End-to-End Encryption** — TLS 1.3 in transit, AES-256 at rest
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture** — Per-tenant encryption keys. We cannot read your data
- **Full Audit Trail** — Immutable, tamper-proof logs for every agent action
- **Compliance-Ready** — Built for regulated environments. Role-based access, data residency controls, audit-ready infrastructure
- **Credential Vault** — Hardware-backed secrets management, injected at runtime
- **Sandboxed Execution** — Isolated containers with kernel-level enforcement

## Projects
